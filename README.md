Problem: Create a Science Trivia Game using HTML, CSS, jQuery, and Javascript. There should be a "Start" window and when the user clicks on this a page with questions will appear. The game is on a 120 second timer. Once the timer is up or the user submits their questions a window will appear with the score the user received based upon correct and incorrect answers.

Solution: Created an on click function so that the Start window disappears when clicked. Created an on click function to have the questions appear. This trivia game is still a work in progress.
